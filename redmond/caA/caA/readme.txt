Dr. Redmond,

My program uses the Marvel API to find all characters appearing in the Captain America (2004 - 2011).
I first use regular expressions to find only those characters who have images available.
Then I record the character's name, along with the source for the character's image.  
These I write to a csv file.
The program should be run three times, each time incrementing the offset by 20, so that all characters are found.
